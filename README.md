#Raspberry Pi 5 Object Detection Using TensorFlow and OpenCV
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a lightweight, efficient object detection system using TensorFlow and OpenCV on the new Raspberry Pi 5. Designed to introduce practical applications of artificial intelligence in robotics, this system can recognize and locate objects in real time from video streams captured through the Raspberry Pi camera. The project involves developing a custom model from scratch, training it with a suitable dataset, and deploying it to the Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow Lite to achieve real-time performance.

Key Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Detects objects in real-time with the Raspberry Pi camera module.
Custom TensorFlow Model: Uses a custom-designed neural network trained specifically for efficient performance on edge devices.
OpenCV Integration: Leverages OpenCV for video capturing and preprocessing, interfacing seamlessly with TensorFlow Lite for inference.
Raspberry Pi Optimized: Fully optimized for running on Raspberry Pi 5, ensuring fast and reliable performance in robotic applications.
Technologies Used
Raspberry Pi 5: The latest model of the Raspberry Pi series, offering enhanced processing power suitable for on-device AI applications.
TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite: For model development, training, and deployment in a format optimized for edge devices.
OpenCV: For handling all image processing and video stream operations.
Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
Setup and Installation
Hardware Setup: Assemble your Raspberry Pi 5 with a camera module and ensure it's connected to the internet.
Software Installation: Install all required software packages and libraries on your Raspberry Pi (detailed instructions available in the Installation section).
Model Training and Conversion: Train your model on a more powerful system and convert it to TensorFlow Lite format (step-by-step guide provided).
Usage
To start the object detection, run the main script provided in the repository. The system will activate the camera and begin detecting objects in its field of view. Results will be displayed in real-time on the connected display or within an SSH terminal session.
